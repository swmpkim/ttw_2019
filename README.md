Things to have on your computer **before** the workshop:
========================================================

Software
--------

You need to install R first, then RStudio. **You may need a system administrator for installation**, so do this early!

### 1. R, v. 3.5.2 or higher

Download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) for any operating system.

### 2. RStudio, v. 1.1.463 or higher

Download the free Desktop version from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for any operating system.

### 3. R Packages

There are two `.r` files you need to download by right-clicking below. Once they're saved on your computer, open each in RStudio (first open RStudio, then from the toolbar select `open script` and navigate to it).

The first one to run is: `00a_package_installation.R`: right click [here](https://github.com/swmpkim/ttw_2019/blob/master/00a_package_installation.R) to download

After that has finished, run `00b_package_check.R` to make sure all packages installed properly; : right click [here](https://github.com/swmpkim/ttw_2019/blob/master/00b_package_check.R) to download

Reserve-specific data
---------------------

### 1. Status Report package

Link to google drive? Where do these live for reserves?

### 2. Raw sonde and/or MET files

Choose your own adventure on this - bring files straight off the EXOs, and bring a handful of WQ and MET files that have been emailed back to you when you upload data to the CDMO.
